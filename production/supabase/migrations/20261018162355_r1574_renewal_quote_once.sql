--
-- R-1574 (P1 money, 18 Oct 2026) — a renewal quote is made AND linked to its subscription in
-- ONE transaction, once per subscription term; paying a renewal quote that lost its link still
-- renews the subscription it was made for.
--
-- ─── WHAT WAS WRONG ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--   lib/renewals/create-renewal-quote.ts and lib/domains/renewal.ts made a renewal quote in
--   three separate client calls: next_document_number → insert quote → update
--   subscriptions.renewal_quote_id (the first never even checked the update). Two runs that
--   overlap (cron + "Generate renewal quote", or a cron retry) each saw renewal_quote_id empty
--   and each made a quote; the second link overwrote the first. record_payment recognises a
--   renewal ONLY by subscriptions.renewal_quote_id = the quote, so paying the other one was
--   treated as a NEW SALE: a second subscription was created and the real one was not renewed
--   (and is suspended after grace). Reproduced on local Docker, rolled back: two quotes, the
--   unlinked one paid → renewal_date unchanged, 2 subscriptions where there was 1.
--   R-1562 made renewed subscriptions come back to this code every term, so it runs more.
--
-- ─── THE FIX ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--   1. quotes.renewal_subscription_id + quotes.renewal_term_date: which subscription term a
--      renewal quote is FOR, written only by the new RPC. A unique index on the pair makes a
--      second quote for the same subscription term impossible, whatever the caller does.
--   2. create_renewal_quote(subscription, tenant, quote jsonb), SECURITY DEFINER, fail-closed
--      (§17c): locks the subscription row (FOR UPDATE — a concurrent second call waits, then
--      sees the first one's link), returns the linked quote when there is one, re-links an
--      unlinked quote already made for this term, else takes the number (next_document_number,
--      §17a — same transaction, no gap), inserts the quote and links it. All or nothing.
--      The PRICE is still worked out in TypeScript (renewalTerm / the live domain price); the
--      RPC only stores it, after refusing a quote with no amount or no lines.
--   3. record_payment: when no subscription points at the paid quote but the quote names the
--      subscription term it renews (step 1) and that term is still the open one, it is that
--      subscription's renewal — rolled forward, no new subscription. When that term has
--      already moved on (renewed by another quote, or its date changed) the FIRST payment is
--      refused with the next step, instead of silently opening a duplicate subscription.
--      Quotes made before this migration carry no term and behave exactly as before — the
--      duplicates already in the data are listed by scripts/r1574-duplicate-renewal-quotes.mjs
--      (dry run) for a human decision.
--
-- Test: supabase/tests/r1574_renewal_quote_once.test.sql (one rollback, local Docker).

         in full, so `invoices.paid_amount` stayed 0 on every part-paid invoice — and
         Aging and the Balance Sheet both count the whole `net_payable`. A Rs 1,00,000
         invoice with Rs 40,000 received showed Rs 1,00,000 outstanding while the same
         Rs 40,000 was also counted as cash: wrong on both sides of the books at once.
         (Only `sync_project_invoice_paid`, on the project side, ever filled the column,
         which is why it looks populated to anybody who checks a project invoice.)

         paid_amount is written on EVERY payment now. `greatest(0, ...)` because
         v_post_invoice_received is net of advances already adjusted onto the invoice and
         can legitimately go negative; a negative paid_amount would flatter the aging
         rather than merely be wrong.

         status and paid_date still move only on full settlement. invoice_status has no
         'partial' value, and adding one reaches every screen that switches on status —
         that is a change to ask for, not to take. Aging reads net_payable - paid_amount,
         which needs no new status.

         paid_date uses ist_today(): current_date is the UTC day on this server (R-015
         part 1), so an invoice settled at 01:00 IST was stamped yesterday. It is still
         the SETTLEMENT day and not the payment's own received date — record_payment has
         no received-date parameter to read, so the dialog patches that in afterwards. */
