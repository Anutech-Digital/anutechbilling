-- R-2095 P0 (30 Oct 2026, staging P&L check, Excel Technologies): 5 invoices with ₹5,02,250 taxable
-- for money received in April (₹4,04,800), May (₹3,000) and September (₹94,450) were dated
-- October — every invoice was dated "today" when it was raised. October revenue and GSTR-1 were
-- overstated, those months understated. One rule (coordinator, 30 Oct):
--   · generate_invoice (reconcile → new sale / open quote, Record payment, Generate): the latest
--     received receipt's IST day — the bank date of a reconciled line;
--   · raise_subscription_billing (a part of a subscription billed in parts): the part's bill date
--     (its period start);
--   · invoice_date_for_receipt clamps both: not after today, not on or before books_locked_until
--     (the first open day instead — a locked month is never written into).
-- The number comes from the same date (next_document_number's FY). Bodies: generate_invoice from
-- 20261027110130 (R-2023), raise_subscription_billing from 20261029110904 (R-2101) — the latest.
-- Not changed: invoices already raised (no data repair — Pardeep's call).
