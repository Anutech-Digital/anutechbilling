-- R-829 (10 Oct 2026, reported by Abhishek on staging). Quote Q-A378-27-0014-R2 had two
-- Google Workspace lines (Starter + Business Standard) with a domain typed on each. Record
-- payment made two subscriptions, but Business Standard was created with domain NULL
-- ("+ Add domain" on /subscriptions).
--
-- Cause: record_payment (and activate_quote_on_credit) null a subscription's domain when an
-- earlier line of the same quote already used it, because the unique index
-- subscriptions_tenant_quote_domain_unique is (tenant_id, quote_id, lower(domain)): a second
-- subscription with the same domain on one quote could not exist at all. A domain
-- legitimately carries two different products (mixed Workspace licences, Workspace + its
-- support plan), and the operator typed it on that line, so the drop was silent data loss.
-- (Two DIFFERENT typed domains were already kept per line - proved locally.)
--
-- Fix:
--   1. The unique index becomes (tenant_id, quote_id, lower(domain), lower(plan)): still one
--      subscription per domain per product per quote (bulk replays stay idempotent), but two
--      products may share a domain.
--   2. A line's OWN typed domain is always kept unless the SAME plan already has that domain
--      on this quote; that case is returned in domain_conflicts (the Record payment dialog
--      shows it), never blanked silently. A borrowed quote/customer-level domain (line with
--      no domain) still lands on one subscription only, as before.
-- Money is untouched: amounts, MRR, outstanding and POs are identical to the previous bodies
-- (record_payment: 20261010173000_extension_keeps_plan.sql; activate_quote_on_credit:
-- 20261007150000_credit_refuse_split_billing.sql). CREATE OR REPLACE keeps existing grants.
-- Test: supabase/tests/record_payment_line_domains.test.sql (self-asserting, rolled back).

-- 1. Index: one subscription per (quote, domain, plan)

         paid_amount is written on EVERY payment now. `greatest(0, ...)` because
         v_post_invoice_received is net of advances already adjusted onto the invoice and
         can legitimately go negative; a negative paid_amount would flatter the aging
         rather than merely be wrong.

         status and paid_date still move only on full settlement. invoice_status has no
         'partial' value, and adding one reaches every screen that switches on status —
         that is a change to ask for, not to take. Aging reads net_payable - paid_amount,
         which needs no new status.

         paid_date uses ist_today(): current_date is the UTC day on this server (R-015
         part 1), so an invoice settled at 01:00 IST was stamped yesterday. It is still
         the SETTLEMENT day and not the payment's own received date — record_payment has
         no received-date parameter to read, so the dialog patches that in afterwards. */
