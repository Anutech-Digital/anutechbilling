-- R-454 (P0 SECURITY, audit 8 Oct 2026): tenant guards fail CLOSED.
--
-- accept_quote, generate_invoice and raise_subscription_billing guarded with
--   if current_tenant_id() is not null and <row tenant> <> current_tenant_id() then raise
-- so when current_tenant_id() is NULL the check was skipped. That is every signed-in user
-- with no company: customer-portal logins, apprentices, users mid-signup. Proven on the
-- local DB (rolled back): a fresh auth user moved E2E Test Co's quote from 'sent' to
-- 'accepted'. Quote ids are guessable (Q-<code>-<fy>-<n>).
-- next_document_number(p_tenant_id) / next_customer_number(p_tenant) had the same hole:
-- with no company, the PARAMETER tenant was used, so anyone signed in could burn numbers in
-- another company's GST invoice series.
--
-- Now: no company AND not a trusted server path → refused with SQLSTATE 28000.
-- Trusted = auth.role() = 'service_role' (public /quote/<id>/accept, cron/billing,
-- checkout, webhooks — all use the admin client) or a direct DB session with no request
-- role (psql/scripts; session_user not authenticator/anon/authenticated/app_runtime).
-- Own-company callers are unchanged; another company's caller is refused as before.
-- Bodies are the newest definitions (20261007200000 accept_quote + generate_invoice,
-- 20261007130000 raise_subscription_billing, 20260930172000 next_document_number,
-- baseline next_customer_number) with ONLY the guard lines changed. Signatures unchanged,
-- so create or replace keeps every grant.
-- Staging: the deploy script rewrites auth.role() -> public.current_request_role() (R-161).
-- Test: supabase/tests/tenant_guard_fail_closed.test.sql (rolled back).
